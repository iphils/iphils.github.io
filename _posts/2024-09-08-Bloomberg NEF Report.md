Key insights:
1. Current scenario of countries on their promises to Paris Agreement:
	The current NDCs of Brazil, France, the UK, the US and Australia are either in line with or more ambitious than the NZS.
	The NDCs of Germany, South Korea, Japan and India are in line with or better than the ETS, indicating they have scope to raise their ambition to align with the NZS.
	China, Indonesia and Vietnam have the most scope to increase their ambition in their next NDCs, with their current plans falling short of even the ETS.
2. Nine technology Pillars tp Net-Zero Scenraio (NZS)
	1. 1. The EV fleet grows to 1.5 billion vehicles and no new internal combustion engine vehicles sold after 2034
	2. Wind and solar capacity reaches 31 terawatts (TW) – this sees total renewables capacity triple from today to 2030, and then triple again from 2030 to 2050 
	3. Installed battery storage capacity hits 4TW – more than 50 times levels in 2023
	4. Nuclear power capacity roughly triples to 1TW 
	5. Carbon capture capacity grows to 8GtCO2 sequestered per year – up from minimal levels today 
	6. Clean hydrogen use is 390 million tons per year – four times today’s fossil-fuel-based hydrogen demand 
	7. Sustainable aviation fuel consumption hits 88 billion gallons per year – up from minimal levels today 
	8. The world’s power grid grows to million kilometers in length – almost double from today
	9. Heat pumps reach over 500 million installed units cumulatively – a near 10-fold increase from today
	Out of the above only  four are mature, commercially scalable technologies with proven business models: **electric vehicles, renewable power, energy storage and power grids.**
